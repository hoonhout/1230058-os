Offshore boundaries are interpolated/extrapolated from the report:
p:\1230058-os\literatuur\PR1759 diepwatergolfstatistiekEindrapport (definitief, commentaar WD verwerkt).pdf

-Europlatform values are used for most directions.
-For 90, 120, 150 no offshore boundary conditions are used (discussed with Caroline and decided that they would have no effect on the OS, 20-01-2017)
-For direction 180 the values from Scheur West are used to define the offshore boundary conditions as they are more representative than the values at Europlatform (discussed with Caroline to do it this way 20-01-2017). 
-For direction 202.5 an interpolation between the values of Eruoplatform(210) and Scheur West(180) is made.
