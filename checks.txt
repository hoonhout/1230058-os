procedureel										                   ready?
1. -> convergence behaviour local 						per run	                   JM:yes
2. -> convergence behaviour global 						per run
3. -> presence of results (*.TAB, *.NC, *.SP1, *.SP2) &					                   JM:yes
      check *.prt (no errors), comp time < 3 hrs, number of iterations < 60, 
      (or it==60 & >99.5%)							one bulk list for a lot
      	


physical checks										per run					ready?
1. -> wet or dry output locations (4.2)							
2.    within realistic limits at output locations (4.3)					bulk plots, after all			less relevant			
3. -> minimum and maximum Hm0 and Tps and Tm01 per output location over all cases (4.4)	bulk plots, after all
4. -> consistency Hm0 and Tm01 as function of windspeed, winddir, water level (4.5)	bulk plots, after all			almost, please rename to: D338Lm200OOa_hs (?) etc, change x lim lower plot, done(JM)
5. -> spatial (entire domain) maps Hm0, Tps, dHs, dTm					per run (landscape; 2x2 subplots)       yes
6. -> spatial (detail) maps Hm0, Tps, dHs, dTm						per run                                 yes 
7. -> proper boundary conditions NZ at OSK, also for overtopping			per run and bulk plots after all	
8. -> proper boundary conditions OS at OSK						per run and bulk plots after all	almost; please rename to: D338OOa_tm D338OOa_hs etc, done(JM)
9. -> spectra NZ (5 OBS locations) and OS (6 OBS locations + 6 output locations)	per run (like A7.7; A.7.14.c)		JM: almost, cg: please add grid lines or only the horizontal zero line? and maybe less underscores in output filenames??, done(JM)
